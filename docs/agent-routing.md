# Agent Routing and Step Limits

OpenClaude can route different agents to different models, and custom agents
can cap how many tool-use steps they may execute. Both features live in
settings and agent frontmatter — no code changes required.

## Agent step limits

Custom agents can define `maxSteps` as a positive integer to cap how many
tool-use steps a sub-agent may execute. When the limit is reached, OpenClaude
stops additional tool calls and asks the sub-agent for a concise final summary
covering completed work, findings, remaining tasks, and whether another run is
needed. Omitting `maxSteps`, or setting it to an invalid value such as `0` or
malformed input, preserves the default unlimited behavior.

## Explicit teammate provider profiles

For pane/window teammates, Agent's `provider_profile` accepts a saved `/provider`
profile ID or name (ID matches take precedence). It supports native Anthropic,
OpenAI-compatible, OAuth Codex, and local profiles. The child loads the selected
profile locally; credentials and custom authentication headers are not embedded
in its launch command. This does not change the globally active profile.

The selected profile's default model is used unless the Agent call supplies an
explicit model. The binding takes precedence over inherited provider/model flags
and persisted agent routing, and survives settings refreshes. Unknown profiles
fail closed. In-process and idle teammates cannot use this binding because they
share the leader's process environment.

## Agent routing

OpenClaude can route different agents to different models through
settings-based routing. This is useful for cost optimization or splitting work
by model strength.

Add to `~/.openclaude/settings.json`:

> **Note:** `api_key` values in `settings.json` are stored in plaintext. Keep this file private and do not commit it to version control.

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "deepseek-v4-flash": {
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "zai-default": {
      "model": "glm-5.2",
      "base_url": "https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-your-key"
    }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "Explore": "deepseek-v4-flash",
    "Plan": "gpt-4o",
    "general-purpose": "gpt-4o",
    "frontend-dev": "zai-default",
    "default": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

When no routing match is found, the global provider remains the fallback.

`agentRouting` values and explicit Agent tool `model` overrides match keys in
`agentModels`. By default, that key is also the model string sent to the
provider. Set `agentModels.<key>.model` when you want a local route key such
as `zai-default` to call a different provider model name such as `glm-5.2`.

> **Note:** `/provider` changes the global/parent provider for your current
> session. `agentModels` and `agentRouting` are specifically for configuring
> per-agent provider overrides while keeping the parent session unchanged.

> **Note:** `api_key` values in `settings.json` are stored in plaintext. Keep
> this file private and do not commit it to version control.

**Model-only routes (same provider):** Omit `base_url` and `api_key` to run an
agent on a different model using your *current* provider's endpoint and key —
no credential duplication:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "mini": { "model": "gpt-5-mini" }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "verification": "mini"
  }
}
```

**Saved-profile routes:** Use `provider_profile` when the route should use a
saved profile's native transport, OAuth, local endpoint, or custom headers.
Only the profile identity crosses into the teammate process; credentials stay
in the child's local profile store. `provider_profile` cannot be combined with
`base_url` or `api_key`.

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "codex-worker": { "provider_profile": "codex-oauth" },
    "deepseek-worker": {
      "provider_profile": "deepseek-saved",
      "model": "deepseek-chat"
    }
  },
  "agentRouting": {
    "reviewer": "codex-worker",
    "default": "deepseek-worker"
  }
}
```

Pane and window teammates also discover a saved profile automatically when a
requested model is explicitly listed by exactly one profile. This works across
leader providers. A configured `agentModels` entry always wins; unknown model
ids remain unchanged; multiple matching profiles produce an actionable error
so account selection is never silent. In-process subagents cannot use saved
profile routes because they share the leader process environment.

After startup, the child sends a credential-free readiness message containing
its resolved model, provider, and transport. If the first provider turn ends
with an authentication, unsupported-model, or runtime error, the child sends a
fixed failure notification even though normal Stop hooks are skipped for API
errors. The leader can therefore fail the teammate task promptly instead of
leaving it busy until the pane watchdog deadline.

**Built-in agents are routable by their type name.** Useful keys:
`verification` (the read-only auditor that runs before completion; **feature-gated**: requires `VERIFICATION_AGENT` and `tengu_hive_evidence` flag), `Explore`
and `Plan` (if feature-gated on), and `code-reviewer` (requires diff inline). For example, `"agentRouting": { "verification": "mini" }` runs the
verifier on `gpt-5-mini` while your main session stays on its model, but only when the verification gate is active. Absent
any entry, the verifier inherits the main-loop model.

## GitHub Copilot sub-agent optimization

When `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_GITHUB=1`, OpenClaude serializes sub-agent execution to
reduce GitHub Copilot Premium Request consumption. Default behavior is
`GITHUB_COPILOT_MAX_SUBAGENTS=1` (synchronous, one sub-agent at a time).
Tuning vars (all optional):

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_MAX_SUBAGENTS=0` | Suppress sub-agents entirely (sub-agents throw an error). |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_MAX_SUBAGENTS=1` | Force synchronous execution. **Default.** |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_MAX_SUBAGENTS=2..10` | Parsed/clamped but not enforced differently from `=1` (any positive cap = synchronous). |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_ALLOW_SUBAGENTS=1` | Re-enable parallel/background sub-agents, overriding the cap. |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_FORCE_SYNC_SUBAGENTS=1` | Force synchronous execution regardless of cap. |
| `GITHUB_COPILOT_OPTIMIZATION_DISABLED=1` | Disable all of the above; sub-agents run as before this feature. |

The `is_async` field reported in the `tengu_agent_tool_selected` event and the
agent metadata reflects the final execution mode (i.e., `false` when
synchronous is forced). See `.env.example` for the full descriptions.

For best results, use models with strong tool/function calling support.
